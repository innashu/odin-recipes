    These are truly the easiest sheet pan tacos you will ever make. High temperature roasting on a sheet pan makes them crisp and golden, and the beef filling does not need pre-cooking. Try themâ€”you'll be amazed. Top with your favorite taco toppings.

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 ounces diced green chiles</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>10 corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and lightly coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil. 
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        Combine beef, onion, green chiles, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl and mix until well incorporated. 
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave just until softened, about 30 seconds. 
         <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
         Spread about 3 tablespoons beef mixture over half of a tortilla in a very thin layer that reaches to the edges  Spread about 1 tablespoon beans onto the other half. Sprinkle all over with about 2 tablespoons cheese. Fold tortilla in half to make a taco; place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining tortillas, meat and cheese. Brush tops of tacos with remaining oil. 
         <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
         Bake tacos in the preheated oven, flipping halfway through, until lightly browned, toasted, and crisp around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve with desired toppings.
    </ol>
